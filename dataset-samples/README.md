# Dataset Samples
This folder contains a few samples to demonstrate how the exisiting SQL dataset schemas are adapted to GraphQL. The datasets themselves are too large to upload to this repository, so we opt for specific examples.<br>

Each folder contains the following files:
- `"name".sqlite` - The actual database stored in SQLite format
- `schema.graphql` - The database schema translated to GraphQL-recognizable format
- `schema.json` & `simpleSchema.json` - Just like schema.graphql except in JSON format
- `schema.sql` - The database schema in its original SQL form
- `Examples.md` - Example queries of this specific data
